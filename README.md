Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks and file upload attacks are serious security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Using these techniques without proper authorization is illegal and unethical.

If you choose to proceed with this assignment, it is crucial to understand the potential consequences of your actions. You should only perform these exercises in a controlled environment where you have explicit permission to do so.

## Understanding Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks and File Upload Attacks

This project aims to demonstrate how MitM attacks and file upload attacks can be performed and how to protect against them.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

A MitM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, potentially modifying or stealing data.

Common MitM Attack Techniques:

ARP Spoofing:

Involves sending false ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to associate an attacker's MAC address with a target's IP address.
Can be used to redirect traffic to the attacker's system.
Example (using Python's scapy library):
Python
```
from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp

def arp_spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip):
    # ... implementation ...
```
Use code with caution.

DNS Spoofing:

Involves modifying DNS records to redirect traffic to malicious servers.
Can be used to steal credentials or serve malware.
Example (using Python's dnslib library):
Python
```
import dnslib

def dns_spoof(domain, ip):
    # ... implementation ...
```
Use code with caution.

## MitM Protection:

To protect against MitM attacks:

Use HTTPS: Encrypts communication between the client and the server, making it difficult for attackers to intercept data.
Verify Website Certificates: Ensure that you are connecting to the correct website by verifying the SSL/TLS certificate.
Use Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Can help detect and prevent MitM attacks.
Educate Users: Make users aware of the risks of public Wi-Fi and the importance of using HTTPS.
File Upload Attacks

File upload attacks occur when malicious files are uploaded to a web application, potentially leading to code execution, data theft, or other security vulnerabilities.

# Common File Upload Attack Techniques:

## Uploading Malicious Scripts:

Involves uploading files with malicious code, such as PHP, JavaScript, or ASP scripts.
If the server executes these files, it can lead to code injection attacks.
Example (malicious PHP code):
PHP
```
<?php
system($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```
Use code with caution.

## Uploading Web Shells:

Involves uploading a web shell, a small script that provides remote access to the server.
Can be used to execute commands and steal data.
File Upload Protection:

To protect against file upload attacks:

Validate File Types: Check the file extension and content to prevent unauthorized file types.
Input Sanitization: Sanitize file names and content to prevent malicious code injection.
Restrict File Sizes: Limit file size to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
Server-Side Validation: Perform additional checks on the server side to verify file integrity.
File Isolation: Store uploaded files in a secure location and prevent direct execution.
